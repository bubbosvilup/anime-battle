# Anime Battle - Project Overview

## 📌 Project Description

**Anime Battle** is a turn-based battle game where players select a team of anime characters and assign them roles before engaging in a strategic battle against AI. The game consists of three main phases: **Start Menu, Character Selection, and Battle**. Future updates will introduce additional features like animations, sound effects, and an in-depth settings menu.
